1. Produce an app which first reads all cars from cars_exercise.txt used in
previous exercises into a list of dictionaries as in question 3, then asks the user if
they’d like to add or remove a car.


2. If the user specifies that they’d like to add a car, ask them for the make, model and
year of the car and add it to the list of dictionaries, then write the list of dictionaries
back to the text file, formatted in the same way as the original file (3 lines per car:
make, then model, then year). Be careful here not to lose data!


3. If the user specifies that they’d like to remove a car, ask them to specify a make,
model and year. Check the list of dictionaries for a car that fulfils these criteria,
ignoring letter case (i.e. in a case-insensitive way—see question 2).


4. If one is found, ask the user if they’re sure they want to delete it. If they choose yes,
remove the car in question from the list of dictionaries and write out the file again. If
they choose no, skip to point 6.


5. If one is not found, tell the user that the app could not find a car that satisfies the
criteria.


6. Loop back around to point 1 and ask the user if they’d like to add or delete a car
again. This should continue until the user types ‘exit’.
